# hello-world
my first repository

Hey y'all!

This is my very first experience with git. I'm here in hopes of learning  the fundamentals of coding as well as becoming a coder my ultimate career.
I've always been fascinated with computers &  technology. As a 90s kid, access to a computer or even the internet was a rarity.
It wasn't until 1999, when I first experienced as well as experimenting with a personal computer. It was love at  first sight.
My greatest pc memories were the countless times I spent playing Typer Shark to hone my typing skills.
But before I start writing my autobiography, I need to stop blabbering and return to the task at hand  (the github "hello-world" project.)  To be continued....
in this commit, I added a slightly brief intro about me.
